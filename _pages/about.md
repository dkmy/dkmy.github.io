Hi! I'm David, currently a fourth year undergraduate student in Statistics and Biology at Harvard College.

Broadly, my research interests are in developing statistical methods for problems in infectious diseases, protein design, and drug discovery. I am currently writing a senior thesis with professor [Debora Marks](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu/) and [Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/index.html) on semi-supervised approaches to generate protein with desired properties by harnessing both experimental data and evolutionary information. See my [research](https://dkmy.github.io/research/) page for more information and recent publications. 

In the past, I have worked with professor [Pardis Sabeti](https://www.sabetilab.org/) and taken research-based seminars with Sasha Rush and Martin Nowak.
